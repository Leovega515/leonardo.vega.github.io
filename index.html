              <!-- write a paragraph explaining why your person is so great  -->
              <p>russell westbrook is one of my heros because he is a basketball player and hes one of the ones who are always putting in the effort and are very hardworking and they never doubt themselves.Russell Westbrook is one of the best players in the nba he averages a triple double which means he gets double digit points,assist, and rebounds and that may sound easy but its not at all.
